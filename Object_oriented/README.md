************************************
Class: Kind of like a library with structure and functions
Instances: Kind of like a variable 
Attributes: the properties of the objects
Decorator: include classmethod, staticmethod, normal method
				{
				classmethod: 	the 1st argument will be cls;

				staticmethod: 	1st argument is varible, 
								therefore cannot access or edit the 
								info about class;

				magic method: 	overwrite the python built-in class such as 'str'

				normal method: 	the 1st argument is self
				 }
